    "You are to build upon the predictive analysis (classification) that you already completed in the previous mini-project, adding additional modeling from new classification algorithms as well as more explanations that are inline with the CRISP-DM framework. You should use appropriate cross validation for all of your analysis (explain your chosen method of performance validation in detail). Try to use as much testing data as possible in a realistic manner (you should define what you think is realistic and why).\n",
    "This report is worth 20% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a single document. The format of the document can be PDF, *.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the rendered iPython notebook. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.\n",

    "### Dataset Selection\n",
    "Select a dataset identically to the way you selected for the first project work week and mini-project. You are not required to use the same dataset that you used in the past, but you are encouraged. You must identify two tasks from the dataset to regress or classify. That is:\n",

    "- two regression tasks OR\n",
    "- one classification task and one regression task\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your dataset was from the diabetes data you might try to predict two tasks: (1) classifying if a patient will be readmitted within a 30 day period or not, and (2) regressing what the total number of days a patient will spend in the hospital, given their history and specifics of the encounter like tests administered and previous admittance.\n",

Then, we took the subset of the continuous predictors: `cert_max_gr_wt`,`afm_hrs_last_insp`,`rwy_len`, and `rwy_width` and removed all the NAs. We were left with approximately 35,000 rows that would be usable for prediction.\n",

So we renamed the columns, replaced the NAs in these columns with 0 and summed all them to get a total injuries column. We wanted to only include the total injuries and drop the other types of injury columns. From there, we converted the total injuries column to a binary variable for classification. If the total injuries were greater than 1, it is considered injured and less than 1 is uninjured. Our last step was to impute all the NA's for the categorical values with an unknown value called `UNK` In all, we are left with the dataframe `final_df` which consisted of 21 columns and 35,427 observations. \n",

So there are three factor levels that were removed called `UNKNOWN`, `UNK` and `OTHER`, because we would like to predict specific broad phases of flights where aviation accidents occured. Additionally, we wanted to include the several injury columns in this dataframe because it may be important in predicting the broad phase. inj_f_grnd, inj_m_grnd, and inj_s_grnd represent the number of minor, fatal and serious ground injuries. Total_Fatal_Injuries, Total_Minor_Injuries, Total_Serious_Injuries correspond to the number of injuries occured that were serious, minor, or fatal on the flight. The Total_Uninjured correspond to the total number of uninjured people on the flight and Total_Injuries_Flight correspond to the total number of injuries that have occured on the flight. So we are left with 26 predictors and 35,427 instances. The response variable has 11 factor levels for each broad phase of flight which have been coded to integers. Shown here:\n",

    "Our final preprocess method was one-hot encoding our categorical variables. We did not standardize and scale continuous predictors for the same reasons before. Certain aircraft weights (cert_max_gr_wt) and runway widths (rwy_width) may be more prone to causing an incident/accident at a specific phase of flight."

    "For example, safety regulations can improved, because the model could be used to understand the underlying factors that result in incidents that cause injuries. Predicting the broad phase of flight allows the NTSB and FAA to implement more safety measures at these stages of flight. Aircraft inspectors could use the phase of flight model to better predict the aircrafts that are more likely to have an incident at a specific broad phase of flight. Finally, the models provide insight about feature importance for all the interested parties. The model would be deployed so it can be tested on new incidents that have occured. There is more data we can collect that we had not added which include more information about the crew such as crew size, and experience. Certain attributes could be better predictors for both our classification problems. The model would need to be update every couple of months because new data is usually added at the beginning of each month."
